The quickstarts provide step by step instructions for various common Duende IdentityServer scenarios. They start with the absolute basics and become more complex - it is recommended you do them in order.

* adding Duende IdentityServer to an ASP.NET Core application
* configuring Duende IdentityServer
* issuing tokens for various clients
* securing web applications and APIs
* adding support for EntityFramework based configuration
* adding support for ASP.NET Identity

Every quickstart has a reference solution - you can find the code in the [samples]({{< param qs_base >}}) folder.

## Preparation
The first thing you should do is install our templates:

```
dotnet new install Duende.IdentityServer.Templates
```

They will be used as a starting point for the various tutorials.
