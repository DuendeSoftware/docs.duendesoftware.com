### Mutual TLS using Kestrel 
This sample shows how to use Kestrel using MTLS for [client authentication]({{<ref "/tokens/authentication/mtls">}}) and [proof of possesion]({{<ref "/tokens/pop">}}) API access.
Using Kestrel will not likely be how MTLS is configured in a production environment, but it is convenient for local testing.
This approach requires DNS entries for *mtls.localhost* and *api.localhost* to resolve to *127.0.0.1*, and is easily configured by modifying your local *hosts* file.
