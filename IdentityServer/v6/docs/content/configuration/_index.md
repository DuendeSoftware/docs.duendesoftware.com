(Added in 6.3)

The Configuration API is a collection of endpoints that allow for management and
configuration of an IdentityServer implementation. The Configuration API can be
hosted either separately or within the IdentityServer implementation, and is
distributed through the separate [Duende.IdentityServer.Configuration nuget
package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Duende.IdentityServer.Configuration).

In this initial release, the Configuration API supports the Dynamic Client
Registration protocol.

The Configuration API is part of the
[IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) 
Business Edition or higher. The same [license](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver#pricing) 
and [special offers](https://duendesoftware.com/specialoffers) apply.

The Configuration API's source code is available [on
github](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/tree/main/src/Configuration).

Samples of the Configuration API are available [here]({{< ref "/samples/configuration" >}}).
