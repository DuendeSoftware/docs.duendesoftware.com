# Duende BFF Security Framework for Blazor applications

Microsoft Blazor is a framework for building interactive web applications using C# and .NET. Blazor allows developers to create rich, dynamic web UIs with the same ease as building desktop applications. 


The Duende BFF (Backend for Frontend) Security Framework addresses common security challenges faced by Blazor applications. It provides a unified approach to managing authentication and authorization, ensuring secure interactions between the client and server. Hereâ€™s how it helps:

Unified Authentication State: The Duende BFF Security Framework unifies the authentication state across different Blazor rendering modes (Server, WebAssembly and Auto). This ensures that users have a consistent and secure authentication experience, regardless of how the Blazor app is rendered.
