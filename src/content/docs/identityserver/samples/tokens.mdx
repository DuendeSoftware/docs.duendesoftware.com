This section contains a collection of samples demonstrating Duende IdentityServer token-related features..

### Extension grants And Token Exchange

This sample shows an implementation of the Token Exchange specification [RFC 8693](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8693)
via the [Duende IdentityServer extension grant mechanism](/identityserver/tokens/extension-grants.md).

### Personal Access Tokens (PAT)

This sample shows how to provide a self-service UI to create access tokens. This is a common approach to enable
integrations with APIs without having to create full-blown OAuth clients.

When combining PATs with the [reference token](/identityserver/tokens/reference.md) feature, you also get automatic
validation and revocation support. This is very similar to API keys, but does not require custom infrastructure. The
sample also contains an API that accepts both JWT and reference tokens.
