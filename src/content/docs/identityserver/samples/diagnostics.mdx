This section contains a collection of samples demonstrating various diagnostics options in Duende IdentityServer.

### OpenTelemetry With .NET Aspire

Duende IdentityServer emits [OpenTelemetry metrics, traces and logs](/identityserver/diagnostics/otel.md).
This sample uses .NET Aspire to display OpenTelemetry data. The solution contains an IdentityServer host, an API and a web client.
The access token lifetime is set to a tiny value to force frequent refresh token flows.

Running the sample requires the dotnet aspire workload to be installed with `dotnet workload install aspire`. Run the
`Aspire.AppHost` project, it will automatically launch the other projects.

This sample is not intended to be a full Aspire sample, it simply uses Aspire as a local standalone tool for displaying
traces, logs and metrics.

### OpenTelemetry Tracing

Duende IdentityServer emits [OpenTelemetry traces for input validators, stores and response generators](/identityserver/diagnostics/otel.md).

The sample shows how to set up OpenTelemetry for console tracing.
