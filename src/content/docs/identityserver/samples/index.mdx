We have a collection of runnable samples that show how to use IdentityServer and configure client applications in a variety of scenarios.

The source code for the samples is in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/Samples/tree/main/IdentityServer/v7).

Most of the samples include both their own IdentityServer implementation and the clients and APIs needed to demonstrate the illustrated functionality.
The [_Basics_](/identityserver/samples/basics.mdx) samples use a [shared IdentityServer implementation](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/samples/tree/main/IdentityServer/v7/IdentityServerHost).
Some samples use our public [demo instance of IdentityServer](https://demo.duendesoftware.com/).
