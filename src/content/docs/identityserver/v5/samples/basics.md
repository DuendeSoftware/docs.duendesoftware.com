This solution contains a collection of common scenarios.

### Client Credentials
This sample shows how to use the *client_credentials* grant type. This is typically used for machine to machine communication.

Key takeaways:

* how to request a token using client credentials
* how to use a shared secret
* how to use access token

### JWT-based Client Authentication
This sample shows how to use the *client_credentials* grant type with JWT-based client authentication. This authentication method is more recommended than shared secrets.

Key takeaways:

* create a JWT for client authentication
* use a JWT as a client secret replacement
* configure IdentityServer to accept a JWT as a client secret

### Introspection & Reference Tokens
This sample shows how to use the reference tokens instead of JWTs.

Things of interest:

* the client registration uses *AccessTokenType* of value *Reference*
* the client requests *scope2* - this scope is part of an API resource.
  * API resources allow defining API secrets, which can then be used to access the introspection endpoint
* The API supports both JWT and reference tokens, this is achieved by forwarding the token to the right handler at runtime

Key takeaways:

* configuring a client to receive reference tokens
* set up an API resource with an API secret
* configure an API to accept and validate reference tokens

### MVC Client Sample
This sample shows how to use the *authorization_code* grant type. This is typically used for interactive applications like web applications.

Key takeaways:

* configure an MVC client to use IdentityServer
* access tokens in ASP.NET Core's authentication session
* call an API
* manually refresh tokens

### MVC Client with automatic Access Token Management
This sample shows how to use [IdentityModel.AspNetCore](https://identitymodel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/aspnetcore/overview.html) to automatically manage access tokens.

The sample uses a special client ID in the sample IdentityServer with a short token lifetime (75 seconds). When repeating the API call, make sure you inspect the returned *iat* and *exp* claims to observer how the token is slides.

You can also turn on debug tracing to get more insights in the token management library.

Key takeaways:

* use IdentityModel.AspNetCore to automate refreshing tokens

### MVC Client with JAR and JWT-based Authentication
This sample shows how to use signed authorize requests, and JWT-based authentication for clients in MVC. It also shows how to integrate that technique with automatic token management.

Key takeaways:

* use the ASP.NET Core extensibility points to add signed authorize requests and JWT-based authentication
* use JWT-based authentication for automatic token management
* configure a client in IdentityServer to share key material for both front- and back-channel

### MVC Client with Back-Channel Logout Notifications
This sample shows how to use back-channel logout notifications.

Key takeaways:

* how to implement the back-channel notification endpoint
* how to leverage events on the cookie handler to invalidate the user session
