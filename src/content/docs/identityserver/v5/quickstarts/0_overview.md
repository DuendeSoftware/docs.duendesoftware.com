* configuring Duende IdentityServer
* issuing tokens for various clients
* securing web applications and APIs
* adding support for EntityFramework based configuration
* adding support for ASP.NET Identity

Every quickstart has a reference solution - you can find the code in the [samples](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/Samples/tree/main/IdentityServer/v5/Quickstarts) folder.
