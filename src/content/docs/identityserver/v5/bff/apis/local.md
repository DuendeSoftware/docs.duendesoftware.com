A local API can be any invocable functionality that is located inside the BFF host, for example an MVC controller or just a simple endpoint.

These endpoints need to be secured to make sure that only the frontend can call them. We recommend doing this using two layers of protection:

**SameSite cookies**

SameSite cookies are a built-in feature of modern browsers to make sure that a cookie only gets sent from a page that originates from the same site where the cookie was originally issued on.

This is a good first layer of defense, but makes the assumption that you can trust all sub-domains of your top-level site, for example **.mycompany.com*.

**Anti-forgery header**

In addition to the cookie protection, we recommend requiring an additional custom header, for example:

```text
GET /endpoint

x-csrf: 1
```

The fact that the header value is static is really not important. Its presence in combination with the cookie requirement will trigger CORS preflight request for cross-origin calls. This effectively sandboxes the caller to the same origin as the backend which is a very strong security guarantee.

In addition, API endpoints also need some special treatment in situations where the session has expired, or authorization fails. In these cases you want to avoid trigger an authentication redirect to the upstream IdP, but instead return Ajax-friendly status codes

### Setup
Duende.BFF can automate above pre/post-processing of API endpoints. For that you need to add the BFF middleware to the pipeline:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    // rest omitted

    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseBff();

    app.UseAuthorization();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => { ... }
}
```

:::note
The BFF middleware must be placed before the authorization middleware, but after routing.
:::

In addition, the endpoints that want the extra security features described above must be decorated, e.g.:

```csharp
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    // MVC controllers
    endpoints.MapControllers()
        .RequireAuthorization()    // no anonymous access
        .AsBffApiEndpoint();       // BFF pre/post processing

    // simple endpoint
    endpoints.MapPost("/foo", context => { ... })
        .RequireAuthorization()
        .AsBffApiEndpoint();
});
```

Or if using MVC, an attribute can be applied directly to the controller or action:

```csharp
[Route("myApi")]
[BffApi]
public class MyApiController : ControllerBase
{ ... }
```

:::note
You can disable the anti-forgery protection requirement by setting the *requireAntiForgeryCheck* parameter to *false* on the endpoint, controller or action. This is not recommended though.
