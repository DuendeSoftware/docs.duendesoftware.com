IdentityServer itself is stateless and does not require server affinity - but there is data that needs to be shared between in multi-instance deployments.

## Configuration data
This typically includes:

* resources
* clients
* startup configuration, e.g. key material, external provider settings etcâ€¦

The way you store that data depends on your environment. In situations where configuration data rarely changes we recommend using the in-memory stores and code or configuration files. In highly dynamic environments (e.g. Saas) we recommend using a database or configuration service to load configuration dynamically.

## Operational data
For certain operations, IdentityServer needs a persistence store to keep state, this includes:

* issuing authorization codes
* issuing reference and refresh tokens
* storing consent
* automatic management for signing keys

You can either use a traditional database for storing operational data, or use a cache with persistence features like Redis.

Duende IdentityServer includes storage implementations for above data using EntityFramework, and you can build your own. See the [data stores](../data) section for more information.
