This upgrade guide covers upgrading from Duende IdentityServer v5.0 to v5.1 ([release notes](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/products/releases/tag/is%2F5.1.0)). Fortunately there's not much to do :)

## Step 1: Update NuGet package

In your IdentityServer host project, update the version of the NuGet. 
For example in your project file:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Duende.IdentityServer" Version="5.0.0" />
```

would change to: 

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Duende.IdentityServer" Version="5.1.0" />
```

## Step 2: Update Database Schema (if needed)

If you are using a [database](/identityserver/v5/data) for your operational data, then there is a small database schema update.
This includes:

* A new index on the *ConsumedTime* column in the *PersistedGrants* table ([more details](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/pull/84)).

If you are using the *Duende.IdentityServer.EntityFramework* package as the implementation for the database and you're using EntityFramework Core migrations as the mechanism for managing those schema changes over time, the commands below will update those migrations with the new changes.
Note that you might need to adjust based on your specific organization of the migration files.

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add Update_DuendeIdentityServer_v5_1 -c PersistedGrantDbContext -o Data/Migrations/IdentityServer/PersistedGrantDb
```

Then to apply those changes to your database:

```bash
dotnet ef database update -c PersistedGrantDbContext
```

## Step 3: Done!

That's it. Of course, at this point you can and should test that your IdentityServer is updated and working properly.
