The `IHttpResponseWriter` interface is the contract for services that can produce HTTP responses for `IEndpointResult`s.
This is a low level abstraction that is intended to be used if you need to customize the serialization, encoding, or
HTTP headers in a response from a protocol endpoint.

#### Duende.IdentityServer.Hosting.IHttpResponseWriter

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Contract for a service that writes appropriate http responses for <see
/// cref="IEndpointResult"/> objects.
/// </summary>
public interface IHttpResponseWriter<in T>
    where T : IEndpointResult
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Writes the endpoint result to the HTTP response.
    /// </summary>
    Task WriteHttpResponse(T result, HttpContext context);
}
```

#### Duende.IdentityServer.Hosting.IEndpointResult

```cs
/// <summary>
/// An <see cref="IEndpointResult"/> is the object model that describes the
/// results that will returned by one of the protocol endpoints provided by
/// IdentityServer, and can be executed to produce an HTTP response.
/// </summary>
public interface IEndpointResult
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Executes the result to write an http response.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="context">The HTTP context.</param>
    Task ExecuteAsync(HttpContext context);
}
```
