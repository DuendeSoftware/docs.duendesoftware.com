This upgrade guide covers upgrading from Duende IdentityServer v7.3 to v7.4 ([release notes](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/products/releases/tag/is-7.4.0)).

IdentityServer 7.4.0 is a significant release that includes:

- Support for .NET 10
- Support for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata ([RFC 8414](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414.html))
- New Callback option for path detection in Dynamic Providers
- Improved UI locales support
- Support for custom parameters in the Authorize Redirect Uri
- Identity package now persists session claims based on an interface
- Skipping front-channel logout iframe when unnecessary
- Set HTTP activity name on routing

There are no schema changes needed for IdentityServer 7.4. Small code changes maybe be required for some users to upgrade:

- Removed the unused `Duende.IdentityServer.Models.DiscoveryDocument` class which was public
- Marked static properties referring to counters in `Telemetry.cs` as `readonly`

## Step 1: Update NuGet package

In your IdentityServer host project, update the version of the NuGet.
For example in your project file:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Duende.IdentityServer" Version="7.3.0" />
```

would change to:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Duende.IdentityServer" Version="7.4.0" />
```

## Step 2: Breaking Changes

Small code changes maybe be required for some users to upgrade.

#### Removed the unused `Duende.IdentityServer.Models.DiscoveryDocument` class which was public

In the process of internal code cleanup, we found that the `Duende.IdentityServer.Models.DiscoveryDocument` class was 
public but not used anywhere in the codebase. 

If you were using this class in your codebase, you will need to replace it with your own implementation or use a 
different class that provides similar functionality. You can find the removed class in the [pull request][1].

#### Marked static properties referring to counters in `Telemetry.cs` as `readonly`

In the process of internal code cleanup, these properties were updated to be marked as `readonly`. 
Code should not have been updating these properties as it would likely change the behavior of the telemetry emitted by 
IdentityServer. 

Any code which was updating these properties should instead create its own counters for their specific scenario.

## Step 3: Done!

That's it. Of course, at this point you can and should test that your IdentityServer is updated and working properly.
