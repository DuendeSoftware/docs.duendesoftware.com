This upgrade guide covers upgrading from IdentityServer4 to Duende IdentityServer v7.2.
IdentityServer4 reached its end of life (EOL) on December 13, 2022. It is strongly advised to migrate to Duende IdentityServer.

Depending on your current version of IdentityServer4, different steps may be required.
You can determine the version of IdentityServer4 by running the `dotnet list` command at the root of your IdentityServer host project, or using NuGet tooling in Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs syncKey="operatingSystem">
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    <Code
      code={'dotnet list package | sls "IdentityServer4"'}
      lang="bash"
      title="Terminal"
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS / Linux">
    <Code
      code={"dotnet list package | grep IdentityServer4"}
      lang="bash"
      title="Terminal"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This command will print a list of packages you are using in your solution, along with their version.

```bash title="Output"
   > IdentityServer4                            3.1.4       3.1.4
   > IdentityServer4.EntityFramework            3.1.4       3.1.4
```

Depending on the package version shown, your next steps will be different:

- If you are on IdentityServer v3.x, we recommend first [upgrading to IdentityServer4 v4.x](#identityserver4-v3x-to-identityserver-v4x), and then to [Duende IdentityServer](#identityserver4-v4x-to-duende-identityserver). The configuration object model changed between the two major versions of IdentityServer4, and we recommend upgrading step-by-step.
- If you are on IdentityServer v4.x, you can immediately [upgrade to Duende IdentityServer](#identityserver4-v4x-to-duende-identityserver).

## IdentityServer4 v3.x to IdentityServer v4.x

The most straightforward upgrade path is to first update to the latest version of IdentityServer4 v4, and then continue to the latest Duende IdentityServer.

:::tip[Sample project]
We have a [sample project available on GitHub](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/UpgradeSample-IdentityServer4-v3), which contains database migration scripts for these changes.
:::

Between IdentityServer4 v3.x and v4.x, the configuration object model was updated:

- The relation between `ApiResources` and `ApiScopes` was changed from parent-child to many-to-many.
- A number of configuration types were renamed:
  - `ApiProperties` to `ApiResourceProperties`
  - `ApiSecrets` to `ApiResourceSecrets`
  - `IdentityClaims` to `IdentityResourceClaims`
  - `IdentityProperties` to `IdentityResourceProperties`
  - `ApiScopes` to `ApiResourceScopes`

IdentityServer4 projects that use the `IdentityServer4.EntityFramework` package or implement their own stores will need to update their code and/or database to reflect these changes.

:::caution
Database changes will need to be done using a custom migration script, as using the default Entity Framework Core migration will result in data loss. We'll look at this later in this upgrade guide.
:::

### Step 1: Update NuGet Packages

Update the IdentityServer4 dependencies in your IdentityServer host project to version `4.1.2`.

```diff lang="xml" title=".csproj"
- <PackageReference Include="IdentityServer4" Version="3.1.4" />
+ <PackageReference Include="IdentityServer4" Version="4.1.2" />
```

Make sure to change the version number for all IdentityServer4 packages, including `IdentityServer4.EntityFramework` and `IdentityServer4.AspNetIdentity`.

### Step 2: Make Code Changes

It's likely some code changes will be required, especially when using the IdentityServer UI templates.
[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) provide great code completion that can be of help here.

:::tip[Use the new Razor Pages templates]
If you have not made customizations to the IdentityServer UI templates, consider replacing them with the new Razor Pages-based templates as shown in [the quickstart tutorials](../../quickstarts/0-overview).
:::

A couple of compilation errors and required changes you may encounter:

* When configuring scopes in memory, you need to register the scopes on startup.

  ```diff lang="csharp" title="Program.cs"
  builder.Services.AddIdentityServer()
      .AddInMemory...
  +    .AddInMemoryApiScopes(Config.ApiScopes)
    ```

* The `IIdentityServerInteractionService.GetAllUserConsentsAsync` method was renamed to `IIdentityServerInteractionService.GetAllUserGrantsAsync`
* `ConsentResponse.Denied` was removed. Use the `DenyAuthorizationAsync` instead:

  ```diff lang="csharp" title="*.cs"
  - await _interaction.GrantConsentAsync(context, ConsentResponse.Denied);
  + await _interaction.DenyAuthorizationAsync(context, AuthorizationError.AccessDenied);
  ```

* No overload method `SignInAsync` takes N arguments. The `HttpContext.SignInAsync` signature changed:

  ```diff lang="csharp" title="*.cs"
  // issue authentication cookie with subject ID and username
  - await HttpContext.SignInAsync(user.SubjectId, user.Username, props);
  + var isuser = new IdentityServerUser(user.SubjectId)
  + {
  +     DisplayName = user.Username
  + };
  +
  + await HttpContext.SignInAsync(isuser, props);
  ```

* `AuthorizationRequest` doesn't contain definition for `ClientId`:

  ```diff lang="csharp" title="*.cs"
  - var client = await _clientStore.FindEnabledClientByIdAsync(request.ClientId);
  + var client = await _clientStore.FindEnabledClientByIdAsync(request.Client.ClientId);
  ```

* `AuthorizationRequest` doesn't contain definition for `ScopesRequested`:

  ```diff lang="csharp" title="*.cs"
  - var resources = await _resourceStore.FindEnabledResourcesByScopeAsync(request.ScopesRequested);
  + var resources = await _resourceStore.FindEnabledResourcesByScopeAsync(request.ValidatedResources.RawScopeValues);
  ```

* `IClientStore` doesn't contain definition for `IsPkceClientAsync`:

  ```diff lang="csharp" title="*.cs"
  - if (await _clientStore.IsPkceClientAsync(context.ClientId))
  + if (context.IsNativeClient())
  ```

* The name `ProcessLoginCallbackForOidc` does not exist in the current context:

  ```diff lang="csharp" title="*.cs"
  - ProcessLoginCallbackForOidc(result, additionalLocalClaims, localSignInProps);
  - ProcessLoginCallbackForWsFed(result, additionalLocalClaims, localSignInProps);
  - ProcessLoginCallbackForSaml2p(result, additionalLocalClaims, localSignInProps);
  + ProcessLoginCallback(result, additionalLocalClaims, localSignInProps);
  ```

* `ConsentResponse` does not contain a definition for `ScopesConsented`:

  ```diff lang="csharp" title="*.cs"
  grantedConsent = new ConsentResponse
  {
      RememberConsent = model.RememberConsent,
  -    ScopesConsented = scopes.ToArray()
  +    ScopesValuesConsented = scopes.ToArray()
  };
  ```

### Step 3: Update Database Schema

If you are using the `IdentityServer4.EntityFramework` package to store configuration and operational data in a [database](../../data),
you'll need to create two database migrations that update the database schema.
Note that you may want to change the database migration paths in the examples below to reflect your project structure.

:::caution
Make sure to verify the database migrations as part of your IdentityServer4 upgrade, to ensure all configuration and operational data remains in place.
:::

For the operational data, you can create and apply an Entity Framework Core migration that targets the `PersistedGrantDbContext` database context.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>

1. Create the migration:

   ```bash title="Terminal"
   dotnet ef migrations add Grants_v4 -c PersistedGrantDbContext -o Migrations/PersistedGrantDb
   ```

2. Apply the migration to your database:

   ```bash title="Terminal"
   dotnet ef database update -c PersistedGrantDbContext
   ```

</Steps>

For your configuration data, the conversation from the old schema to the new will need to be performed by applying a custom SQL script.
We'll start with creating a migration that targets the `ConfigurationDbContext` database context:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>

1. Create the migration:

   ```bash title="Terminal"
   dotnet ef migrations add Config_v4 -c ConfigurationDbContext -o Migrations/ConfigurationDb
   ```

   You will see a message _"An operation was scaffolded that may result in the loss of data. Please review the migration for accuracy."_ in the output.
   To avoid data loss, the migration will need to be updated.

2. To ensure no data is lost, make sure to include the [`ConfigurationDb_v4_delta.sql`](https://github.com/DuendeArchive/UpgradeSample-IdentityServer4-v3/blob/main/IdentityServerMigrationSample/ConfigurationDb_v4_delta.sql)
   script in your project.

   You can add the script as an embedded resource by updating the `.csproj` file:

   ```xml title=".csproj"
   <ItemGroup>
       <EmbeddedResource Include="ConfigurationDb_v4_delta.sql" />
   </ItemGroup>
   ```

   :::note[Update the SQL script for your database type]
   The `ConfigurationDb_v4_delta.sql` file assumes you are using SQL Server. If a different database server type is used for your IdentityServer host, you'll need to update the SQL script to use the correct syntax.
   :::

3. Modify the migration class that was just created and replace it with the following code:

   ```csharp title="Config_v4.cs"
   using System.IO;
   using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Migrations;

   namespace IdentityServerMigrationSample.Migrations.ConfigurationDb
   {
       public partial class Config_v4 : Migration
       {
           protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
           {
               var assembly = typeof(Program).Assembly;

               using (var s = assembly.GetManifestResourceStream("IdentityServerMigrationSample.ConfigurationDb_v4_delta.sql"))
               {
                   using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(s))
                   {
                       var sql = sr.ReadToEnd();
                       migrationBuilder.Sql(sql);
                   }
               }
           }

           protected override void Down(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
           {
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. Apply the migration to your database:

   ```bash title="Terminal"
   dotnet ef database update -c ConfigurationDbContext
   ```

</Steps>

Your database schema should now be updated. You can verify all data is intact, using the [queries outlined in `query_v4.sql`](https://github.com/DuendeArchive/UpgradeSample-IdentityServer4-v3/blob/main/IdentityServerMigrationSample/query_v4.sql).
These queries may return a lot of data, consider adding a `TOP` clause if you want to only sample some of the migrated data.

<details>
    <summary>View SQL queries to validate migration succeeded</summary>

    ```sql title="query_v4.sql"
    SELECT * FROM __EFMigrationsHistory

    SELECT * FROM ApiResourceClaims
    SELECT * FROM ApiResourceProperties
    SELECT * FROM ApiResources
    SELECT * FROM ApiResourceScopes
    SELECT * FROM ApiResourceSecrets

    SELECT * FROM ApiScopeClaims
    SELECT * FROM ApiScopes
    SELECT * FROM ApiScopeProperties

    SELECT * FROM ClientClaims
    SELECT * FROM ClientCorsOrigins
    SELECT * FROM ClientGrantTypes
    SELECT * FROM ClientIdPRestrictions
    SELECT * FROM ClientPostLogoutRedirectUris
    SELECT * FROM ClientProperties
    SELECT * FROM ClientRedirectUris
    SELECT * FROM Clients
    SELECT * FROM ClientScopes
    SELECT * FROM ClientSecrets

    SELECT * FROM DeviceCodes
    SELECT * FROM PersistedGrants

    SELECT * FROM IdentityResourceClaims
    SELECT * FROM IdentityResourceProperties
    SELECT * FROM IdentityResources
    ```

</details>

With the migration to IdentityServer v4.x complete, you can [upgrade to Duende IdentityServer](#identityserver4-v4x-to-duende-identityserver).

## IdentityServer4 v4.x to Duende IdentityServer

Upgrading from IdentityServer4 v4.x to Duende IdentityServer consists of several tasks: updating the target .NET version, updating NuGet packages, and performing database schema migrations.

### Step 1: Update the .NET Version

In this guide, we'll update to .NET 8 LTS. If your application targets a newer .NET version, you can use that newer version for the IdentityServer host as well.

Update the IdentityServer target framework:

```diff lang="xml" title=".csproj"
- <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
+ <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

Some of your project dependencies may need updating as part of changing the target framework.
For example, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google` will need to be updated to the version matching your target framework.

:::tip[Updating .NET and ASP.NET Core]
Depending on the amount of customization in your IdentityServer4 host and UI templates, there may be code changes needed based on updates to .NET and ASP.NET Core.
Make sure to consult the ASP.NET Core migration guides provided by Microsoft.

</details>
:::

### Step 2: Update NuGet Packages

Update the IdentityServer4 dependencies in your IdentityServer host project to Duende IdentityServer.

```diff lang="xml" title=".csproj"
- <PackageReference Include="IdentityServer4" Version="4.1.2" />
+ <PackageReference Include="Duende.IdentityServer" Version="7.2.0" />
```

You'll need to make a similar change for all IdentityServer4 packages, including `IdentityServer4.EntityFramework` and `IdentityServer4.AspNetIdentity`. For example:

```diff lang="xml" title=".csproj"
- <PackageReference Include="IdentityServer4.EntityFramework" Version="4.1.2" />
+ <PackageReference Include="Duende.IdentityServer.EntityFramework" Version="7.2.0" />
```

The IdentityModel package was renamed to Duende IdentityModel and needs updating if you reference it directly:

```diff lang="xml" title=".csproj"
- <PackageReference Include="IdentityModel" Version="x.y.z" />
+ <PackageReference Include="Duende.IdentityModel" Version="7.0.0" />
```

### Step 3: Update Namespaces

In your project source code, replace all `IdentityServer4` namespace usages with `Duende.IdentityServer`:

```diff lang="csharp" title="*.cs"
- using IdentityServer4;
- using IdentityServer4.Models;
+ using Duende.IdentityServer;
+ using Duende.IdentityServer.Models;
```

Replace all `IdentityModel` namespace usages with `Duende.IdentityModel`:

```diff lang="csharp" title="*.cs"
- using IdentityModel;
+ using Duende.IdentityModel;
```

If you are using fully-qualified names in your code, those will need to be updated as well.

### Step 4: Remove AddDeveloperSigningCredential :badge[Optional]

In your application startup code, typically found in the `ConfigureServices` method in `Startup.cs`, consider removing `AddDeveloperSigningCredential`.

You can use Duende IdentityServer's built-in [manual or automatic key management](../../fundamentals/key-management) instead.

### Step 5: Update Database Schema

Whether you are using a [database](../../data) or a [custom store implementation](../..//reference/stores) for your configuration and operational data, you'll need to make some changes.
The exact steps involved in updating your data store will depend on your implementation details.

In this section, we'll look at updating the database schema based on the stores provided in the `Duende.IdentityServer.EntityFramework` package:

- Create a new `Keys` table for the automatic key management feature in the operational database.
- Create a new `RequireResourceIndicator` boolean column on the `ApiResources` table in the configuration database.
- Create a new index on the `ConsumedTime` column in the `PersistedGrants` table ([more details](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/products/pull/84)).
- Create a new table called `IdentityProviders` for storing the OIDC provider details ([more details](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/products/pull/188)).
- Add missing columns for created, updated, etc. to EF entities ([more details](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/products/pull/356)).
- Add unique constraints to EF tables where duplicate records are not allowed ([more details](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/products/pull/355)).
- The server-side sessions feature requires a new table ([more details](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/products/pull/743)).
- The session coordination feature adds a column to the `Clients` table ([more details](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/products/pull/820)).
- Improve primary keys on the persisted grants table ([more details](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/products/pull/793)).
- Add new properties to the [`Duende.IdentityServer.Models.Client` model](/identityserver/reference/models/client):

  - `InitiateLoginUri` is a nullable string used for Third Party Initiated Login.
  - `RequireDPoP` is a non-nullable boolean flag that controls if a client is required to use [DPoP](../../tokens/pop).
  - `DPoPValidationMode` is a non-nullable column that controls the DPoP validation mechanism. Existing clients that are not using DPoP can set its value to `0`.
  - `DPoPClockSkew` is a non-nullable timespan that controls how much clock skew is allowed for a particular DPoP client. Existing clients that are not using DPoP can set its value to a timespan of length ``0.

- Two new properties have been added to the `Client` model:
  - `Client.RequirePushedAuthorization` is a new boolean property that controls if this client requires [pushed authorization requests (PAR)](../../tokens/par). It is safe to initialize this column to `false` for existing clients, which will mean that the global PAR configuration will be used.
  - `Client.PushedAuthorizationLifetime` is a new nullable integer property that controls the lifetime of pushed
    authorization requests (in seconds) for a client. It is safe to initialize this column to `null` for existing clients, which means the global value is used.
- A new `PushedAuthorizationRequest` table has been added to store pushed authorization requests.

You'll need to create two database migrations that update the database schema: one that targets the `PersistedGrantDbContext` (for operational data), and one that targets the `ConfigurationDbContext` (for configuration data).
Note that you may want to change the database migration paths in the examples below to match your project structure.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>

1. Create the migrations for the operational and configuration database context:

   ```bash title="Terminal"
   dotnet ef migrations add UpdateToDuende_v7_0 -c PersistedGrantDbContext -o Data/Migrations/IdentityServer/PersistedGrantDb
   dotnet ef migrations add UpdateToDuende_v7_0 -c ConfigurationDbContext -o Data/Migrations/IdentityServer/ConfigurationDb
   ```

   :::note
   You may see a warning _"An operation was scaffolded that may result in the loss of data. Please review the migration for accuracy."_.
   The column length for redirect URIs (for both login and logout) was reduced from 2000 to 400 to overcome database index size limits.
   Unless you are using redirect URIs greater than 400 characters, this should not affect you.
   :::

2. Apply the migrations to your database:

   ```bash title="Terminal"
   dotnet ef database update -c PersistedGrantDbContext
   dotnet ef database update -c ConfigurationDbContext
   ```

</Steps>

### Step 6: Migrate Signing Keys :badge[Optional]

If your IdentityServer4 implementation is using a signing key, consider using [automatic key management](../../fundamentals/key-management) which is included in the Business license.

:::tip[Determine if you are using a custom signing key]
In `Startup.cs`, look for a call to `AddSigningCredential()` that uses key material such as an `X509Certificate2`.
:::

Client apps and APIs typically cache the key material published from IdentityServer's discovery document.
When upgrading, consider how those applications will handle an upgraded token server with a new and different signing key.

- If you can restart all client apps and APIs that depend on your current signing key, you can remove the old signing key and start to use automatic key management. A restart reloads the discovery document and the new signing key.
- If you can not restart client apps and APIs, check the [manual and automatic key rotation topics](../../fundamentals/key-management#manual-key-rotation) to learn how to announce new signing key material while still supporting the old signing key for a period of time.

### Step 7: Verify Data Protection Configuration :badge[Optional]

Duende IdentityServer depends on [ASP.NET Data Protection](/identityserver/deployment/index.md#aspnet-core-data-protection) to encrypt and sign data using keys managed by ASP.NET.

As part of your migration, verify the application name is set in your Data Protection configuration:

```csharp title="Program.cs" {4}
builder.Services.AddDataProtection()
    .PersistKeysTo...()
    .ProtectKeysWith...()
    .SetApplicationName("IdentityServerXYZ");
```

If an application name is set, you can skip this section.

Data Protection keys are isolated by application name, to prevent multiple applications from sharing encryption keys.

If no application name is configured, ASP.NET Data Protection uses the content root path of the IdentityServer host as the application name.
As a consequence, if your content root path changes, the default settings for data protection will prevent you from using your old data protection keys.

Between different .NET versions, this default setting has changed:

| Version  | Default                                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| .NET 3.1 | Content root path without directory separator suffix           |
| .NET 5   | Content root path without directory separator suffix           |
| .NET 6   | Content root path (normalized with directory separator suffix) |
| .NET 7+  | Content root path without directory separator suffix           |

Your application name might change (and existing data protection keys may become invalid) if you are currently targeting .NET 6 and do not have the application name set explicitly.

To prevent this from happening, you can explicitly set the application name to the content root path without the directory separator character, as [documented on Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/data-protection/configuration/overview?view=aspnetcore-6.0#setapplicationname).

:::tip[Getting the current application name]
In your current (pre-upgraded) IdentityServer version, you can query the application name used and set it explicitly in your upgraded deployment:

```csharp
// ...

var app = builder.Build();

// ...
var applicationName = app.Services
    .GetRequiredService<IOptions<DataProtectionOptions>>()
    .Value.ApplicationDiscriminator;

// applicationName is now the (auto-generated?) application name
// - you can use it in your upgraded IdentityServer version
```

:::

### Step 8: Validate Your Deployment

Congratulations! Your upgrade is complete.

Make sure to validate and test your Duende IdentityServer is working as expected, and check integrations with your client applications and APIs.

:::note
IdentityServer is free for development, testing, and personal projects, but production use
requires a [license](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver).
:::

## Breaking Changes

Duende IdentityServer is a Software Development Kit (SDK) that you can use to build your own identity and access management solutions (IAM).
Being an SDK, there is a lot of potential for customization during the implementation. Depending on your specific project, breaking changes might affect your use of IdentityServer.

As part of your upgrade from IdentityServer4 to Duende IdentityServer, we recommend reviewing these breaking changes to understand if any of them affect you.
