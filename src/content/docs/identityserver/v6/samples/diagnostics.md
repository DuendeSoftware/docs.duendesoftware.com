### OpenTelemetry support
[link to source code](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/Samples/tree/main/IdentityServer/v6/Diagnostics/Otel)

IdentityServer emits OpenTelemetry traces for input validators, stores and response generators (see [here](/identityserver/v6/diagnostics/otel) for more information).

The samples show how to set up Otel for console tracing.
