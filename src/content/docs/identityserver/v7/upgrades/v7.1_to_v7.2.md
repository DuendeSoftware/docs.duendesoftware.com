This upgrade guide covers upgrading from Duende IdentityServer v7.1 to v7.2 ([release notes](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/products/releases/tag/is-7.2.0)).

## What's New
Duende IdentityServer 7.2 adds:
- Do not issue *TokenIssuedFailureEvent* for *use_dpop_nonce* error
- Use *AsyncServiceScope* in Background Services
- Use query-safe URL fragment when returning an error
- Add an option for strict validation of assertion audiences
- General improvements to XML documentation and null reference exception handling
- Preview Features: Strict Audience Validation and Discovery Document Caching
- Bug fixes and ongoing maintenance

There are no changes to the data stores in this release.

## Step 1: Update NuGet package

In your IdentityServer host project, update the version of the NuGet.
For example in your project file:

```
<PackageReference Include="Duende.IdentityServer" Version="7.1.0" />
```

would change to:

```
<PackageReference Include="Duende.IdentityServer" Version="7.2.0" />
```


## Step 2: Done!

That's it. Of course, at this point you can and should test that your IdentityServer is updated and working properly.
