| CoordinateLifetimeWithUserSession { get; set; }     | When enabled, the client's token lifetimes (e.g. refresh tokens) will be tied to the user's session lifetime. This means when the user logs out, any revokable tokens will be removed.

This client's setting overrides the global CoordinateTokensWithUserSession configuration setting.

| RequireSignedRequestObject { get; set; }            | Boolean value specifying whether authorization requests must be protected as signed request objects and provided through either the request or request_uri parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Scope { get; set; }                                 | String containing a space-separated list of scope values that the client can use when requesting access tokens. If omitted, the configuration API will register a client with the scopes set by the `DynamicClientRegistrationValidator.SetDefaultScopes` method, which defaults to no scopes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| SoftwareId { get; set; }                            | A unique identifier string (e.g., a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)) assigned by the client developer or software publisher used by registration endpoints to identify the client software to be dynamically registered. Unlike "client_id", which is issued by the authorization server and SHOULD vary between instances, the "software_id" SHOULD remain the same for all instances of the client software. The "software_id" SHOULD remain the same across multiple updates or versions of the same piece of software. The value of this field is not intended to be human readable and is usually opaque to the client and authorization server. The default validator must be extended to make use of the `SoftwareId`. The default implementation ignores this property. |
| SoftwareStatement { get; set; }                     | A software statement containing client metadata values about the client software as claims. This is a string value containing the entire signed JWT. The default validator must be extended to make use of the software statement.

| SoftwareVersion { get; set; }                       | A version identifier string for the client software identified by "software_id". The value of the "software_version" SHOULD change on any update to the client software identified by the same "software_id". The value of this field is intended to be compared using string equality matching and no other comparison semantics are defined by this specification. The default validator must be extended to make use of the `SoftwareVersion`. The default implementation ignores this property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## DynamicClientRegistrationResponse
Represents the response to a successful dynamic client registration request. This class extends the registration request by adding additional properties that are generated server side and not set by the client.

```csharp
public class DynamicClientRegistrationResponse : DynamicClientRegistrationRequest, IDynamicClientRegistrationResponse
```

#### Public Members
| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| ClientId { get; set; } | Gets or sets the client ID. |
| ClientSecret { get; set; } | Gets or sets the client secret. |
| ClientSecretExpiresAt { get; set; } | Gets or sets the expiration time of the client secret. |
| ResponseTypes { get; set; } | List of the OAuth 2.0 response type strings that the client can use at the authorization endpoint. |

## DynamicClientRegistrationContext
Represents the context of a dynamic client registration request, including
the original DCR request, the client model that is built up through validation
and processing, the caller who made the DCR request, and other contextual
information.

```csharp
public class DynamicClientRegistrationContext
```

#### Public Members
| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| Caller { get; set; } | The ClaimsPrincipal that made the DCR request. |
| Client { get; set; } | The client model that is built up through validation and processing. |
| Items { get; set; } | A collection where additional contextual information may be stored. This is intended as a place to pass additional custom state between validation steps. |
| Request { get; set; } | The original dynamic client registration request. |

## DynamicClientRegistrationError
Represents an error that occurred during validation of a dynamic client
registration request. This class implements the appropriate [marker interfaces](#marker-interfaces) so
that it can be returned from various points in the validator or processor.

```csharp
public class DynamicClientRegistrationValidationError : IStepResult, IDynamicClientRegistrationResponse, IDynamicClientRegistrationValidationResult
```

#### Public Members
| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| Error { get; set; } | Gets or sets the error code for the error that occurred during validation. Error codes defined by RFC 7591 are defined as constants in the `DynamicClientRegistrationErrors` class. |
| ErrorDescription { get; set; } | Gets or sets a human-readable description of the error that occurred during validation. |

## Marker Interfaces
#### IDynamicClientRegistrationResponse
Marker interface for the response to a dynamic client registration request. This
interface has two implementations;
[`DynamicClientRegistrationResponse`](#dynamicclientregistrationresponse) indicates
success, while [`DynamicClientRegistrationError`](#dynamicclientregistrationerror) indicates
failure.

#### IDynamicClientRegistrationValidationResult
Marker interface for the result of validating a dynamic client registration
request. This interface has two implementations;
[`DynamicClientRegistrationValidatedRequest`](#successfulstep) indicates
success, while
[`DynamicClientRegistrationError`](#dynamicclientregistrationerror) indicates
failure. Note that the `DynamicClientRegistrationError` implements multiple
interfaces and can be used throughout the pipeline to convey errors.

#### IStepResult
Marker interface for the result of a step in the dynamic client registration
validator or processor. This interface has two implementations;
[`SuccessfulStep`](#successfulstep) indicates success, while
[`DynamicClientRegistrationError`](#dynamicclientregistrationerror) indicates
failure. Note that the `DynamicClientRegistrationError` implements multiple
interfaces and can be used throughout the pipeline to convey errors.

### IStepResult Convenience Functions
Your validation or processing steps can return a call to convenience functions in the static class `StepResult` to
conveniently construct a success or failure from a step wrapped in a task.

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| static Task\<IStepResult\> Success() | Indicates that the validation step was completed was completed successfully | 
| static Task\<IStepResult\> Failure(string errorDescription) | Indicates that the validation step failed with the specified error description and the default error code of invalid_client_metadata | 
| static Task\<IStepResult\> Failure(string errorDescription, string error) |Indicates that the validation step failed with the specified error description and error code | 

## DynamicClientRegistrationValidatedRequest
Represents a successfully validated dynamic client registration request.

```csharp
public class DynamicClientRegistrationValidatedRequest : DynamicClientRegistrationValidationResult
```

## SuccessfulStep
Represents a successful validation step.

```csharp
public class SuccessfulStep : IStepResult
```
