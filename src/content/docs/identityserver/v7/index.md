Duende IdentityServer is a framework for implementing OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 in .NET applications. It enables
secure access to APIs and single sign-on functionality for your applications. With IdentityServer, you can act as an
identity provider (issuing tokens to clients), validate tokens, and support various authentication scenarios, including
resource owner password credentials, authorization code flow, and more.

It is highly customizable, allowing developers to add authentication and authorization features tailored to specific use
cases, including integration with external identity providers such as Google, Azure AD, and others.
