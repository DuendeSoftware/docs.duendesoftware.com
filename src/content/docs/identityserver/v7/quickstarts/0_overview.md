The quickstarts provide step-by-step instructions for various common Duende IdentityServer scenarios. They start with
the absolute basics and become more complex - it is recommended you do them in order.

* adding Duende IdentityServer to an ASP.NET Core application
* configuring Duende IdentityServer
* issuing tokens for various clients
* securing web applications and APIs
* adding support for EntityFramework based configuration
* adding support for ASP.NET Identity

Every quickstart has a reference solution - you can find the code in
the [samples](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/Samples/tree/main/IdentityServer/v7/Quickstarts) folder.

## Preparation

The first thing you should do is install our templates:

```bash title=Terminal
dotnet new install Duende.Templates
```

They will be used as a starting point for the various tutorials.

:::note
You may have a previous version of Duende templates (`Duende.IdentityServer.Templates`) installed on your machine.
Please uninstall the template package and install the latest version.
