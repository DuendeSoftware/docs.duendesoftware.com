Duende.IdentityModel.OidcClient is an OpenID Connect (OIDC) client library for mobile and native
applications in .NET. It is a certified OIDC relying party and implements [RFC
8252](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252/), "OAuth 2.0 for native
Applications". It provides types that describe OIDC requests and responses, low level
methods to construct protocol state and handle responses, and higher level methods for
logging in, logging out, retrieving userinfo, and refreshing tokens.

OidcClient can be used with .NET and .NET Framework. We support .NET 6.0 or later and .NET
Framework 4.6.2 or later.

You can use OidcClient to build:
- Android and iPhone apps with .NET MAUI
- Windows Desktop Applications with WPF or WinForms
- Cross Platform Console Applications
