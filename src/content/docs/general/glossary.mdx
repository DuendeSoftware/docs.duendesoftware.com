The glossary below provides definitions and explanations of commonly used terms and features within the security and
identity management domain. Explore each term to gain a deeper understanding of its functionality and relevance.

## Client

A client is a piece of software that requests tokens from your IdentityServer - either for authenticating a user (
requesting an identity token) or for accessing a resource (requesting an access token). A client must be first
registered with your IdentityServer before it can request tokens and is identified by a unique client ID.

There are many different client types, e.g. web applications, native mobile or desktop applications, SPAs, server
processes, etc.

## Automatic Key Management

**License: <Badge text="Business" />**

The automatic key management feature creates and manages key material for signing tokens and follows best practices for
handling this key material, including storage and rotation.

## Server-side Session Management

**License: <Badge text="Business" />**

The server-side session management feature extends the ASP.NET Core cookie authentication handler to maintain a user's
authentication session state in a server-side store, rather than putting it all into a self-contained cookie. Using
server-side sessions enables more architectural features in your IdentityServer, such as:

- query and manage active user sessions (e.g. from an administrative app).
- detect session expiration and perform cleanup, both in IdentityServer and in client apps.
- centralize and monitor session activity in order to achieve a system-wide inactivity timeout.

## BFF Security Framework

**License: <Badge text="Business" />**

The Duende Backend For Frontend (BFF) security framework packages up guidance and the necessary components to secure
browser-based frontends (e.g. SPAs or Blazor WASM applications) with ASP.NET Core backends.

## Dynamic Client Registration

**License: <Badge text="Business" />**

Implementation of [RFC 8707](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8707). Provides a standards-based endpoint to register
clients and their configuration.

## Pushed Authorization Requests

**License: <Badge text="Business" />**

Implementation of [RFC 9126](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9126.html). Provides a more secure way to start a
browser-based token/authentication request.

## Dynamic Authentication Providers

**License: <Badge text="Enterprise" />**

The dynamic configuration feature allows dynamic loading of configuration for OpenID Connect providers from a store.
This is designed to address the performance concern and allowing changes to the configuration to a running server.

## Resource Isolation

**License: <Badge text="Enterprise" />**

The resource isolation feature allows a client to request access tokens for an individual resource server.
This allows API-specific features such as access token encryption and isolation of APIs that are not in the same trust
boundary.

## Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA)

**License: <Badge text="Enterprise" />**

Duende IdentityServer supports the Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow (also known as CIBA).
This allows a user to log in with a higher security device (e.g. their mobile phone) than the device on which they are
using an application (e.g. a public kiosk).
CIBA is one of the requirements to support the Financal-grade API compliance.

## Proof-of-Possession At The Application Layer / DPoP

**License: <Badge text="Enterprise" />**

A mechanism for sender-constraining OAuth 2.0 tokens via a proof-of-possession mechanism on the application level. This
mechanism allows for the detection of replay attacks with access and refresh tokens.

## Single Deployment

A single deployment acts as a single OpenID Connect / OAuth authority hosted at a single URL. It can consist of multiple
physical or virtual nodes for load-balancing or fail-over purposes.

## Multiple Deployment

Can be either completely independent single deployments, or a single deployment that acts as multiple authorities.

## Multiple Authorities

A single logical deployment that acts as multiple logical token services on multiple URLs or host names (e.g. for
branding, isolation or multi-tenancy reasons).
