The `Duende.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth2Introspection` library implements an ASP.NET Core authentication handler for
OAuth 2.0 token introspection, as defined in [RFC 7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662), "OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection".

## Use Case

Using this library, you can request information about access tokens from an authorization server, allowing your
ASP.NET Core application to validate tokens and retrieve metadata about them. This enables you to use opaque tokens in
your application, where the token itself does not carry any information about the user or the scopes granted, but instead
relies on the authorization server to provide this information.

:::tip
By default, you can also use this library to introspect JWT tokens.
You can disable this behavior by setting `SkipTokensWithDots = true` in the [`OAuth2IntrospectionOptions`](/introspection-auth-handler/options.mdx).

## Features

- Implements the OAuth 2.0 token introspection protocol.
- Supports both opaque and JWT access token introspection.
- Supports caching of introspection results to reduce load on the authorization server.
- Provides a customizable authentication handler for ASP.NET Core.
- Integrates seamlessly with ASP.NET Core's authentication middleware.

## Installation

If you want to use the `Duende.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth2Introspection` library, you need to add the NuGet package
to your ASP.NET Core project.

You can achieve this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dotnet package add Duende.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth2Introspection
```

## Configuration

To configure the OAuth 2.0 token introspection handler in your ASP.NET Core application, you need to add it to the
authentication services in your `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` file.

Here's an example on how to set it up:

```csharp
// Program.cs
using Duende.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth2Introspection;

builder.Services.AddAuthentication(OAuth2IntrospectionDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddOAuth2Introspection(options =>
    {
        options.Authority = "https://demo.duendesoftware.com"; // Replace with your authorization server's URL

        options.ClientId = "client_id_for_introspection_endpoint";
        options.ClientSecret = "client_secret_for_introspection_endpoint";
    });
```

More details on the available options can be found on the [options page](/introspection-auth-handler/options.mdx).

### Configuring the Backchannel HTTP Client

You can configure the HTTP client used by the introspection handler to make requests to the introspection endpoint, for example,
when your ASP.NET Core application lives behind a proxy or requires specific HTTP client settings.

```csharp
// Program.cs
builder.Services.AddHttpClient(OAuth2IntrospectionDefaults.BackchannelHttpClientName)
    .AddHttpMessageHandler(() =>
    {
        // Configure client/handler for the back channel HTTP Client here
        return new HttpClientHandler
        {
            UseProxy = true,
            Proxy = new WebProxy(WebProxyUri, true)
        };
    });
```
