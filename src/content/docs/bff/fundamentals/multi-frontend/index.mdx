The Backend For Frontend pattern basically states that there should 
be a single backend for each frontend. While for some applications / architectures this
makes a lot of sense, because there is a 1-to-1 mapping between the api surface
and the browser based application, for some other architectures this may not be useful.

Especially in micro-service based architectures, where there are many backend api's 
and multiple frontends using these apis, having a dedicated backend service for each frontend
introduces quite a lot of operational overhead. 

To overcome this issue, a single BFF instance can support multiple frontends. Each frontend you configure can:
* Define it's own OpenID Connect configuration
* Define it's own Cookie settings
* Define it's own api surface
* Be identified either via path based routing and/or origin selection. 

Adding additional frontends to the BFF has very little impact on the performance on the BFF itself, but keep in mind
that the traffic for all the frontends is proxied through the bff. 

## Authentication configuration


When you use multiple frontends, you can't rely on [manual authentication configuration](../fundamentals/session/handlers.mdx#manually-configuring-authentication).
This is because each frontend requires it's own scheme, and potentially it's own OpenID Connect and Cookie configuration. 

Instead, you should rely on [automatic authentication configuration](../fundamentals/session/handlers.mdx#automatic-authentication-configuration).

Below is an example on how to configure multiple frontends. 

```csharp
var bffBuilder = builder.Services
    .AddBff();

bffBuilder
    .ConfigureOpenIdConnect(options =>
    {
        // These are the default values for all frontends.
        options.Authority = "https://demo.duendesoftware.com";
        options.ClientId = "interactive.confidential";
        options.ClientSecret = "secret";
        options.ResponseType = "code";
        options.ResponseMode = "query";

        options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
        options.SaveTokens = true;
        options.MapInboundClaims = false;

        options.Scope.Clear();
        options.Scope.Add("openid");
        options.Scope.Add("profile");
        options.Scope.Add("api");
        options.Scope.Add("offline_access");

        options.TokenValidationParameters.NameClaimType = "name";
        options.TokenValidationParameters.RoleClaimType = "role";
    });

    .AddFrontends(

        // This frontend will use the default authentication options
        new BffFrontend(BffFrontendName.Parse("default-frontend")),

        // This frontend uses most of the same authentication options,
        new BffFrontend(BffFrontendName.Parse("with-path"))
            .MappedToPath(LocalPath.Parse("/with-path")),
            .WithOpenIdConnectOptions(opt =>
            {
               // but overrides the clientid and client secret.
                opt.ClientId = "different-client-id";
                opt.ClientSecret = "different secret";
            })
            .WithCookieOptions(opt => 
            {
               // and overrides the cookie options to use 'lax' cookies. 
               opt.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Lax;
            });

```

The order in which configuration is applied is
1. programmatic default options (if any)
2. default options from configuration (if any)
3. frontend specific options (if any)

Each frontend can have custom OpenID Connect configuration and Cookie Configuration. This can both be configured programmatically 
as via [Configuration](./configuration.mdx). 

## Frontend selection

Each request to a frontend has to be uniquely defined by either it's path, it's origin or a combination of the two. 
If you specify neither, then it's considered the default frontend. 

Frontends are matched using the following algorithm:

1. **Selection by both origin and path:** If there is a frontend that matches both the origin AND has the most specific match to a path, then it's selected. 
2. **Selection by origin only:** Then if there is a frontend with only origins configured and it matches the path, then it's selected. 
3. **Selection by path only:** Then if there is a frontend with a matching path specified, then it's selected. 
4. **Default frontend:** Then if there is a default frontend configured, then it's selected.  

Basically, the most specific match will be selected. 

:::note
When using path based routing, then the frontend's path is added to the [PathBase](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httprequest.pathbase) 
and removed from the [Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httprequest.path). This means that any routing
that happens in the application is relative to the path of the frontend. This also includes the openid callback paths.

## Adding a frontend during startup

The simplest way to add frontends is during startup. 

```csharp {3}
services
    .AddBff()
    .WithFrontends(new BffFrontend(BffFrontendName.Parse("frontend1")));
```
You can call WithFrontends with multiple frontends in one go, or call it multiple times. 

## Adding / updating a frontend dynamically at runtime

If you want to manipulate the frontends at runtime, you can do so via the IFrontendCollection interface. 

```csharp
var frontends = app.Services.GetRequiredService<IFrontendCollection>();

frontends.AddOrUpdate(new BffFrontend(name));

frontends.Remove(name);
```

## Defining the api surface

A frontend can define it's own api surface, by specifying remote api's. 

```csharp

var frontend = new BffFrontend(BffFrontendName.Parse("frontend1"))
   .WithRemoteApis(
      // map the local path /path to the remote api
      new RemoteApi(LocalPath.Parse("/some_path"), new Uri("https://remote-api")))

      // You can also configure various options, such as the type of token,
      // retrieval parameters, etc.. 
      new RemoteApi(LocalPath.Parse("/with_options"), new Uri("https://remote-api")))
        .WithAccessToken(RequiredTokenType.UserOrClient),
        .WithAccessTokenRetriever<ImpersonationAccessTokenRetriever>(),
        .WithUserAccessTokenParameters(new BffUserAccessTokenParameters { Resource = Resource.Parse("urn:isolated-api") }));
```

See the topic on [Token Management](../tokens.md) for more information about the various token management options. 

## Index HTML proxying

When deploying a multi-frontend bff, it makes most sense to have the frontend's configured with an 
Index.HTML file that's retrieved from a CDN. 

```csharp

var frontend = new BffFrontend(BffFrontendName.Parse("frontend1"))
   .WithIndexHtml(new Uri("https://my_cdn/some_app/index.html"))
```

When you do this, the BFF automatically wires up a catch-all route that serves the index.html for that specific frontend. 
See [Serve the index page from the BFF host](../../architecture/ui-hosting.md#serve-the-index-page-from-the-bff-host) for more information.
