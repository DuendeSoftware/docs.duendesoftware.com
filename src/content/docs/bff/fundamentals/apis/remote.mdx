:::note
You will need to have the [`Duende.Bff.Yarp`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Duende.BFF.Yarp) NuGet package installed to use these features.
:::

A _Remote API_ is an API that is deployed separately from the BFF host. Remote APIs use access tokens to authenticate and authorize requests, but the frontend does not possess an access token to make requests to remote APIs directly. Instead, all access to remote APIs is proxied through the BFF, which authenticates the frontend using its authentication cookie, gets the appropriate access token, and forwards the request to the Remote API with the token attached.

There are two different ways to set up Remote API proxying in Duende.BFF. This page describes the built-in simple HTTP forwarder. Alternatively, you can integrate Duende.BFF with Microsoft's [YARP](/bff/fundamentals/apis/yarp.md) reverse proxy, which allows for more complex reverse proxy features provided by YARP combined with the security and identity features of Duende.BFF.

## Direct HTTP Forwarding

Duende.BFF's direct HTTP forwarder maps routes in the BFF to a remote API surface. It uses [Microsoft YARP](https://github.com/microsoft/reverse-proxy) internally, but is much simpler to configure than YARP. The intent is to provide a developer-centric and simplified way to proxy requests from the BFF to remote APIs when more complex reverse proxy features are not needed.

These routes receive automatic anti-forgery protection and integrate with automatic token management.

To enable this feature, add a reference to the [`Duende.BFF.Yarp` NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Duende.BFF.Yarp), add the remote APIs service to the service provider, and then add the remote endpoint mappings.

:::note
The BFF multi-frontend feature has built-in support for direct forwarding. 
:::

#### Add Remote API Service to Service Provider

To use the HTTP forwarder, register it in the service provider:

```csharp {3}
// Program.cs
builder.Services.AddBff()
    .AddRemoteApis();
```

#### Map Remote APIs

Use the `MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint` extension method to describe how to map requests coming into the BFF to remote APIs.

`MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint` takes two parameters: the base path of requests that will be mapped externally, and the address to the external API where the requests will be mapped.

The `MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint` extension method maps a path and all sub-paths below it. The intent is to allow easy mapping of groups of URLs. For example, you can set up mappings for the `/users`, `/users/{userId}`, `/users/{userId}/books`, and `/users/{userId}/books/{bookId}` endpoints without having to explicitly include all of them:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs syncKey="bffVersion">
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <TabItem label="V4">
    <Code
          lang="csharp"
          title="Program.cs"
          code={`app.MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint("/api/users", new Uri("https://remoteHost/users"))
    .WithAccessToken(RequiredTokenType.User);`}/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="V3">
    <Code
          lang="csharp"
          title="Program.cs"
          code={`app.MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint("/api/users", new Uri("https://remoteHost/users"))
    .WithAccessToken(TokenType.User);`}/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
This example opens up the complete */users* API namespace to the frontend, and thus, to the outside world. While it is convenient to register API paths this way, consider if you need to be more specific hen designing the forwarding paths to prevent accidentally exposing unintended endpoints.
:::

The `WithAccessToken` method can be added to [specify token requirements](#access-token-requirements) for the remote API. The BFF will automatically forward the correct access token to the remote API, which will be scoped to the client application, the user, or either.

## Securing Remote APIs

Remote APIs typically require access control and must be protected against threats such as [CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF) attacks. 

To provide access control, you can specify authorization policies on the mapped routes and configure them with access token requirements.

To defend against CSRF attacks, you should use SameSite cookies to authenticate calls from the frontend to the BFF. As an additional layer of defense, APIs mapped with *MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint* are automatically protected with an anti-forgery header. 

#### SameSite cookies

[The SameSite cookie attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value) is a feature of modern browsers that restricts cookies so that they are only sent to pages originating from the [site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Site) where the cookie was originally issued. This prevents CSRF attacks, because cross site requests will no longer implicitly include the user's credentials.

This is a good first layer of defense but makes the assumption that you can trust all subdomains of your site. All subdomains within a registrable domain are considered the same site for purposes of SameSite cookies. Thus, if another application hosted on a subdomain within your site is infected with malware, it can make CSRF attacks against your application.

#### Anti-forgery header

Remote APIs mapped in the BFF always require an additional custom header on API endpoints. For example:

```text
GET /endpoint

x-csrf: 1
```

The value of the header is not important, but its presence, combined with the cookie requirement, triggers a CORS preflight request for cross-origin calls. This effectively isolates the caller to the same origin as the backend, providing a robust security guarantee. 

#### Require authorization

The `MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint` method returns the appropriate type to integrate with the ASP.NET Core authorization system. You can attach authorization policies to remote endpoints using the `WithAccessToken` extension method, just as you would for a standard ASP.NET core endpoint created with `MapGet`. The authorization middleware will then enforce that policy before forwarding requests on that route to the remote endpoint.

:::note
In Duende.BFF version 3, use the `MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint` method with the `RequireAuthorization` extension method to attach authorization policies.
:::

#### Access token requirements

Remote APIs sometimes allow anonymous access but usually require an access token, and the type of access token (user or client) will vary as well. You can specify access token requirements via the `WithAccessToken` extension method. Its `RequiredTokenType` parameter has three options:

* **`None`**

    No token is required.

* **`User`**

    A valid user access token is required and will be forwarded to the remote API. A user access token is an access token obtained during an OIDC flow (or subsequent refresh), and is associated with a particular user. User tokens are obtained when the user initially logs in, and will be automatically refreshed using a refresh token when they expire.

* **`Client`**

    A valid client access token is required and will be forwarded to the remote API. A client access token is an access token obtained through the client credentials flow, and is associated with the client application, not any particular user. Client tokens can be obtained even if the user is not logged in.

* **`UserOrClient`**

    Either a valid user access token or a valid client access token (as fallback) is required and will be forwarded to the remote API.

* **`UserOrNone`**

    A valid user access token will be forwarded to the remote API when logged in. No access token will be sent when not logged in, and no OIDC flow is challenged to get an access token.

:::note
These settings only specify the logic that is applied before the API call gets proxied. The remote APIs you are calling should always specify their own authorization and token requirements.
