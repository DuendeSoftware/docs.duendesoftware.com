Duende BFF Security Framework v3.0 is a significant release that includes:

* .NET 9 support
* Blazor support
* Several fixes and improvements

## Upgrading

If you rely on the default extension methods for wiring up the BFF, then V3 should be a drop-in replacement.

### Migrating from custom implementations of IHttpMessageInvokerFactory

In Duende.BFF V2, there was an interface called `IHttpMessageInvokerFactory`. This class was responsible for creating
and wiring up yarp's `HttpMessageInvoker`. This interface has been removed in favor YARP's
`IForwarderHttpClientFactory`.

One common scenario for creating a custom implementation of this class was for mocking the http client
during unit testing.

If you wish to inject a http handler for unit testing, you should now inject a custom `IForwarderHttpClientFactory`. For
example:

```csharp
// A Forwarder factory that forwards the messages to a message handler (which can be easily retrieved from a testhost)
public class BackChannelHttpMessageInvokerFactory(HttpMessageHandler backChannel) 
    : IForwarderHttpClientFactory
{
    public HttpMessageInvoker CreateClient(ForwarderHttpClientContext context) => 
        new HttpMessageInvoker(backChannel);
}

// Wire up the forwarder in your application's test host:
services.AddSingleton<IForwarderHttpClientFactory>(
     new BackChannelHttpMessageInvokerFactory(_apiHost.Server.CreateHandler()));
```

### Migrating from custom implementations IHttpTransformerFactory

The `IHttpTransformerFactory` was a way to globally configure the YARP tranform pipeline. In V3, the way that
the default `endpoints.MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint()` method builds up the YARP transform has been simplified
significantly. Most of the logic has been pushed down to the *AccessTokenRequestTransform*.

Here are common scenario's for implementing your own *IHttpTransformerFactory* and how to upgrade:

#### Replacing defaults

If you used a custom implementation of `IHttpTransformerFactory` to change the default behavior of
`MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint()`,
for example to add additional transforms, then you can now inject a custom delegate into the DI container:

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<BffYarpTransformBuilder>(CustomDefaultYarpTransforms);

//...

// This is an example of how to add a response header to ALL invocations of MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint()
private void CustomDefaultBffTransformBuilder(string localpath, TransformBuilderContext context)
{
    context.AddResponseHeader("added-by-custom-default-transform", "some-value");
    DefaultBffYarpTransformerBuilders.DirectProxyWithAccessToken(localpath, context);
}
```

Another way of doing this is to create a custom extensionmethod `MyCustomMapRemoteBffApiEndpoint()` that wraps
the `MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint()` and use that everywhere in your application. This is a great way to add other defaults
that should apply to all endpoints, such as requiring a specific type of access token.

#### Configuring transforms for a single route

Another common usecase for overriding the `IHttpTransformerFactory` was to have a custom transform for a single route,
by
applying a switch statement and testing for specific routes.

Now, there is an overload on the `endpoints.MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint()` that allows you to configure the pipeline
directly:

```csharp
endpoints.MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint(
    "/local-path",
    _apiHost.Url(),
    context =>
    {
        // do something custom: IE: copy request headers
        context.CopyRequestHeaders = true;

        // wire up the default transformer logic
        DefaultTransformers.DirectProxyWithAccessToken("/local-path", context);
    })
    // Continue with normal BFF configuration, for example, allowing optional user access tokens
    .WithOptionalUserAccessToken();
```

### Removed method RemoteApiEndpoint.Map(localpath, apiAddress).

The Map method was no longer needed as most of the logic had been moved to either the `MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint` and the
DefaultTransformers. The map method also wasn't very explicit about what it did and a number of test scenario's tried to
verify if it wasn't called wrongly. You are now expected to call the method `MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint`. This method now has
a nullable parameter that allows you to inject your own transformers.

### AccessTokenRetrievalContext properties are now typed

The LocalPath and ApiAddress properties are now typed. They used to be strings. If you rely on these, for example for
implementing
a custom `IAccessTokenRetriever`, then you should adjust their usage accordingly.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// The locally requested path.
/// </summary>
public required PathString LocalPath { get; set; }

/// <summary>
/// The remote address of the API.
/// </summary>
public required Uri ApiAddress { get; set; }
```

### AddAddEntityFrameworkServerSideSessionsServices has been renamed to AddEntityFrameworkServerSideSessionsServices

If you used the method `AddAddEntityFrameworkServerSideSessionsServices()` in your code, please replace it with the
corrected `AddEntityFrameworkServerSideSessionsServices()`.

### StateProviderPollingDelay and StateProviderPollingInterval have been split into separate options for WebAssembly and Server.

If you used `BffBlazorOptions.StateProviderPollingInterval` or `BffBlazorOptions.StateProviderPollingDelay` to configure
different polling settings, you should now consider if this same setting applies to either Server, WASM or both. Set the
appropriate properties accordingly.
