Duende BFF Security Framework v4.0 is a significant release that includes:

* Multi-frontend support
* OpenTelemetry support
* Support for login prompts
* Several fixes and improvements

The extensibility approach has been drastically changed, and many `virtual` methods containing implementation logic are now internal instead.

## Upgrading

This release introduces many breaking changes. This upgrade guide covers cases where a breaking change was introduced.

### Remote APIs

The syntax for configuring remote APIs has changed slightly:

```diff lang="csharp" title="Program.cs"
// Use a client credentials token
- app.MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint("/api/client-token", "https://localhost:5010")
-    .RequireAccessToken(TokenType.Client);

+ app.MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint("/api/client-token", new Uri("https://localhost:5010"))
+    .WithAccessToken(RequiredTokenType.Client);      

// Use the client token only if the user is logged in
- app.MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint("/api/optional-user-token", "https://localhost:5010")
-    .WithOptionalUserAccessToken();

+ app.MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint("/api/optional-user-token", new Uri("https://localhost:5010"))
+    .WithAccessToken(RequiredTokenType.UserOrNone);            
```

* The enum `TokenType` has been renamed to `RequiredTokenType`, and moved from the `Duende.Bff` to `Duende.Bff.AccessTokenManagement` namespace.
* The methods to configure the token type have all been replaced with a new method `WithAccessToken()`
* Requesting an optional access token should no longer be done by calling `WithOptionalUserAccessToken()`. Use `WithAccessToken(RequiredTokenType.UserOrNone)` instead.

### Configuring Token Types In YARP

The required token type configuration in YARP has also changed slightly. It uses the enum values from `RequiredTokenType`.

### Extending The BFF

#### Simplified Wireup Without Explicit Authentication Setup

The V3 style of wireup still works, but BFF V4 comes with a newer style of wireup:

```csharp
services.AddBff()
    .ConfigureOpenIdConnect(options =>
    {
        options.Authority = "your authority";
        options.ClientId = "your client id";
        options.ClientSecret = "secret";
        // ... other OpenID Connect options. 
    }
    .ConfigureCookies(options => {
        // The cookie options are automatically configured with recommended practices.
        // However, you can change the config here. 
    });
```

Adding this will automatically configure a Cookie and OpenID Connect flow.

#### Adding Multiple Frontends

You can statically add a list of frontends by calling the `AddFrontends` method.

```csharp
.AddFrontends(
    new BffFrontend(BffFrontendName.Parse("default-frontend"))
        .WithCdnIndexHtmlUrl(new Uri("https://localhost:5005/static/index.html")),

    new BffFrontend(BffFrontendName.Parse("with-path"))
        .WithOpenIdConnectOptions(opt =>
        {
            opt.ClientId = "bff.multi-frontend.with-path";
            opt.ClientSecret = "secret";
        })
        .WithCdnIndexHtmlUrl(new Uri("https://localhost:5005/static/index.html"))
        .MapToPath("/with-path"),

    new BffFrontend(BffFrontendName.Parse("with-domain"))
        .WithOpenIdConnectOptions(opt =>
        {
            opt.ClientId = "bff.multi-frontend.with-domain";
            opt.ClientSecret = "secret";
        })
        .WithCdnIndexHtmlUrl(new Uri("https://localhost:5005/static/index.html"))
        .MapToHost(HostHeaderValue.Parse("https://app1.localhost:5005"))
        .WithRemoteApis(
            new RemoteApi("/api/user-token", new Uri("https://localhost:5010")),
            new RemoteApi("/api/client-token", new Uri("https://localhost:5010"))
)
```

#### Loading Configuration From `IConfiguration`

Loading configuration, including OpenID Connect configuration from `IConfiguration` is now supported:

```csharp
services.AddBff().LoadConfiguration(bffConfig);
```

This enables you to configure your OpenID Connect options, including secrets, and configure the list of frontends. This also adds a file watcher, to automatically add / remove frontends from the config file.

See the type `BffConfiguration` to see what settings can be configured.

## Handling SPA static assets

The BFF can be configured to handle the static file assets that are typically used when developing SPA based apps. 

### Proxying the Index.HTML only

When deploying a multi-frontend BFF, it makes most sense to have the frontend's configured with an `index.html` file that is retrieved from a Content Delivery Network (CDN). 

This can be done in various ways. For example, if you use Vite, you can publish static assets with a 'base' configured. This will make sure that any static asset,
(such as images, scripts, etc) are retrieved directly from the CDN. This gives the best performance. 

```csharp
var frontend = new BffFrontend(BffFrontendName.Parse("frontend1"))
   .WithCdnIndexHtml(new Uri("https://my_cdn/some_app/index.html"))
```

When you do this, the BFF automatically wires up a catch-all route that serves the `index.html` for that specific frontend. 
See [Serve the index page from the BFF host](/bff/architecture/ui-hosting.md#serve-the-index-page-from-the-bff-host) for more information. 

### Proxying all static assets 

When developing a SPA based application, it's very common to use a development webserver such as Vite. While vite can publish static assets with a 'base',
this doesn't work well during development.

The best development experience can be achieved by configuring the BFF to proxy all static assets from the development server:


```csharp
var frontend = new BffFrontend(BffFrontendName.Parse("frontend1"))
   .WithProxiedStaticAssets(new Uri("https://localhost:3000")); // https://localhost:3000 would be the URL of your development web server.
```

While this can also be done in production, it will proxy all static assets through the BFF. This will increase the bandwidth consumed by the BFF 
and reduce the overall performance of your application. 


### Proxying assets based on environment

If you're using a local development server during development, but a CDN in production, you can also configure this as follows:

``` csharp

// In this example, the environment name from the application builder is used to determine
// if we're running in production or not. 
var runningInProduction = () => builder.Environment.EnvironmentName == Environments.Production;

// Then, when configuring the frontend, you can switch when the static assets will be proxied. 
new BffFrontend(BffFrontendName.Parse("default-frontend"))
    .WithBffStaticAssets(new Uri("https://localhost:5010/static"), useCdnWhen: runningInProduction);

```

:::note
This function is evaluated immediately when calling the method `.WithBffStaticAssets` is called. If you call this method during startup,
then the condition is only evaluated at startup time. It's not evaluated at runtime for every request. 
:::



### Server Side Sessions Database Migrations

When using the server side sessions feature backed by the `Duende.BFF.EntityFramework` package, you will need to script [Entity Framework database migrations](/bff/fundamentals/session/server-side-sessions.mdx#entity-framework-migrations) and apply these changes to your database. 

```shell
dotnet ef migrations add BFFUserSessionsV4 -o Migrations -c SessionDbContext
```

In the `UserSessions` table, a number of changes were introduced:
* The `ApplicationName` column was renamed to `PartitionKey`. This column will contain the BFF frontend name.
* Related indexes were updated.

```sqlite
// serversidesessions.sql
ALTER TABLE "UserSessions" RENAME COLUMN "ApplicationName" TO "PartitionKey";

DROP INDEX "IX_UserSessions_ApplicationName_SubjectId_SessionId";
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "IX_UserSessions_PartitionKey_SubjectId_SessionId" ON "UserSessions" ("PartitionKey", "SubjectId", "SessionId");

DROP INDEX "IX_UserSessions_ApplicationName_SessionId";
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "IX_UserSessions_PartitionKey_SessionId" ON "UserSessions" ("PartitionKey", "SessionId");

DROP INDEX "IX_UserSessions_ApplicationName_Key";
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "IX_UserSessions_PartitionKey_Key" ON "UserSessions" ("PartitionKey", "Key");
```

:::note
This is a breaking database schema change. If you have multiple BFF V3 applications that share the same database table,
you either need to update all BFF applications to V4 at the same time or use a new database for the upgraded BFF V4 application.
