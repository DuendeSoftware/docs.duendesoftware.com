The back-channel logout endpoint has several extensibility points organized into two interfaces.
The `IBackchannelLogoutEndpoint` is the top-level abstraction that processes requests to the endpoint.
This service can be used to add custom request processing logic or to change how it validates incoming requests.
When the back-channel logout endpoint receives a valid request, it revokes sessions using the `ISessionRevocationService`.

<Aside type="caution">
    In BFF V3, the `IBackchannelLogoutEndpoint` interface is called `IBackchannelLogoutService` instead.

## Request Processing

<Tabs syncKey="bffVersion">
    <TabItem label="V4">
        You can customize the behavior of the back-channel logout endpoint by implementing the `ProcessRequestAsync` method of the
        `IBackchannelLogoutEndpoint` interface. The [default implementation][1] can serve as a starting point for your own implementation.

        If you want to extend the default behavior of the back-channel logout endpoint, you can instead add a custom endpoint and
        call the original endpoint implementation:

        <Code
            lang="csharp"
            title="Program.cs"
            code={`
var bffOptions = app.Services.GetRequiredService<IOptions<BffOptions>>().Value;

app.MapGet(bffOptions.BackChannelLogoutPath, async (HttpContext context, CancellationToken ct) =>
{
    // Custom logic before calling the original endpoint implementation
    var endpointProcessor = context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<IBackchannelLogoutEndpoint>();
    await endpointProcessor.ProcessRequestAsync(context, ct);
    // Custom logic after calling the original endpoint implementation
});
`} />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="V3">
        `ProcessRequestAsync` is the top-level function called in the endpoint service `DefaultBackchannelLogoutService`,
        and can be used to add arbitrary logic to the endpoint.

        For example, you could take whatever actions you need before normal processing of the request like this:

        <Code
            lang="csharp"
            code={`
public override Task ProcessRequestAsync(HttpContext context, CancellationToken ct)
{
    // Custom logic here

    return base.ProcessRequestAsync(context);
}
`}/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Session Revocation

The back-channel logout service will call the registered session revocation service to revoke the user session when
it receives a valid logout token. To customize the revocation process, implement the `ISessionRevocationService`.
