The client library for the token endpoint ([OAuth
2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.2) and [OpenID
Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#tokenendpoint))
is provided as a set of extension methods for *HttpClient*. This allows
creating and managing the lifetime of the *HttpClient* the way you
prefer - e.g. statically or via a factory like the Microsoft
*HttpClientFactory*.

Requesting a token
------------------

The main extension method is called *RequestTokenAsync* - it has direct
support for standard parameters like client ID/secret (or assertion) and
grant type, but it also allows setting arbitrary other parameters via a
dictionary. All other extensions methods ultimately call this method
internally:

```csharp
var client = new HttpClient();

var response = await client.RequestTokenAsync(new TokenRequest
{
    Address = "https://demo.duendesoftware.com/connect/token",
    GrantType = "custom",

    ClientId = "client",
    ClientSecret = "secret",

    Parameters =
    {
        { "custom_parameter", "custom value"},
        { "scope", "api1" }
    }
});
```

The response is of type *TokenResponse* and has properties for the
standard token response parameters like *access_token*, *expires_in*
etc. You also have access to the the raw response as well as to a parsed
JSON document (via the *Raw* and *Json* properties).

Before using the response, you should always check the *IsError*
property to make sure the request was successful:

```csharp
if (response.IsError) throw new Exception(response.Error);

var token = response.AccessToken;
var custom = response.Json.TryGetString("custom_parameter");
```

Requesting a token using the *client_credentials* Grant Type
------------------------------------------------------------

The *RequestClientCredentialsToken* extension method has convenience
properties for the *client_credentials* grant type:

```csharp
var response = await client.RequestClientCredentialsTokenAsync(new ClientCredentialsTokenRequest
{
    Address = "https://demo.duendesoftware.com/connect/token",

    ClientId = "client",
    ClientSecret = "secret",
    Scope = "api1"
});
```

Requesting a token using the *password* Grant Type
--------------------------------------------------

The *RequestPasswordToken* extension method has convenience properties
for the *password* grant type:

```csharp
var response = await client.RequestPasswordTokenAsync(new PasswordTokenRequest
{
    Address = "https://demo.duendesoftware.com/connect/token",

    ClientId = "client",
    ClientSecret = "secret",
    Scope = "api1",

    UserName = "bob",
    Password = "bob"
});
```

Requesting a token using the *authorization_code* Grant Type
------------------------------------------------------------

The *RequestAuthorizationCodeToken* extension method has convenience
properties for the *authorization_code* grant type and PKCE:

```csharp
var response = await client.RequestAuthorizationCodeTokenAsync(new AuthorizationCodeTokenRequest
{
    Address = IdentityServerPipeline.TokenEndpoint,

    ClientId = "client",
    ClientSecret = "secret",

    Code = code,
    RedirectUri = "https://app.com/callback",

    // optional PKCE parameter
    CodeVerifier = "xyz"
});
```

Requesting a token using the *refresh_token* Grant Type
-------------------------------------------------------

The *RequestRefreshToken* extension method has convenience properties
for the *refresh_token* grant type:

```csharp
var response = await _client.RequestRefreshTokenAsync(new RefreshTokenRequest
{
    Address = TokenEndpoint,

    ClientId = "client",
    ClientSecret = "secret",

    RefreshToken = "xyz"
});
```

Requesting a Device Token
-------------------------

The *RequestDeviceToken* extension method has convenience properties for
the *urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code* grant type:

```csharp
var response = await client.RequestDeviceTokenAsync(new DeviceTokenRequest
{
    Address = disco.TokenEndpoint,

    ClientId = "device",
    DeviceCode = authorizeResponse.DeviceCode
});
```
