The `Duende.IdentityModel` package is the base library for OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 related protocol
operations. It provides an object model to interact with the endpoints defined in the
various OAuth and OpenId Connect specifications. The types included represent the
requests and responses, in addition to extension methods to invoke requests constants defined in the
specifications, such as standard scope, claim, and parameter names, and other convenience
methods for performing common identity related operations.
