When working with OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect and claims, there are a lot
of "magic strings" for claim types and protocol values. IdentityModel
provides a couple of constant strings classes to help with that.

## OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Protocol Values

The *OidcConstants* class has all the values for grant types, parameter
names, error names etc.

## JWT Claim Types

The *JwtClaimTypes* class has all standard claim types found in the
OpenID Connect, JWT and OAuth 2.0 specs -many of them are also
aggregated at [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml).
