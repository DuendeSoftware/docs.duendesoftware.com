A common place to store X.509 certificates is the Windows X.509
certificate store. The raw APIs for the store are a bit arcane (and also
slightly changed between .NET Framework and .NET Core).

The *X509* class is a simplified API to load certificates from the
store. The following code loads a certificate by name from the personal
machine store:

```csharp
var cert = X509
             .LocalMachine
             .My
             .SubjectDistinguishedName
             .Find("CN=sts")
             .FirstOrDefault();
```

You can load certs from the machine or user store and from *My*,
*AddressBook*, *TrustedPeople*, *CertificateAuthority* and
*TrustedPublisher* respectively. You can search for subject name,
thumbprint, issuer name or serial number.
