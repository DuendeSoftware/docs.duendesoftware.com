The `Duende.AccessTokenManagement` library provides automatic access token management features for .NET worker and ASP.NET Core web applications:

- automatic acquisition and lifetime management of client credentials based access tokens for machine-to-machine communication (using the `Duende.AccessTokenManagement` package)
- automatic access token lifetime management using a refresh token for API calls on behalf of the currently logged-in user (using the `Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect` package)
- revocation of access tokens

:::note
    Duende.AccessTokenManagement version 4 (currently in preview 2) brings significant improvements, but also several breaking
    changes. Please see the [migration guide](/accesstokenmanagement/upgrading/atm-v3-to-v4/) and [release notes](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/foss/releases/tag/atm-4.0.0-Preview.2).
