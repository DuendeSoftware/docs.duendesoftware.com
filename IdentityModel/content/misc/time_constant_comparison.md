Time-Constant String Comparison
===============================

When comparing strings in a security context (e.g. comparing keys), you
should try to avoid leaking timing information.

The *TimeConstantComparer* class can help with that:

```
var isEqual = TimeConstantComparer.IsEqual(key1, key2);
```

Starting with .NET Core 2.1 this functionality is built in via
[CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.cryptographicoperations.fixedtimeequals?view=netcore-2.1)
