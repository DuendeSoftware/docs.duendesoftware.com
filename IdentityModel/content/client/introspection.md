Token Introspection Endpoint
============================

The client library for [OAuth 2.0 token
introspection](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662) is provided as an
extension method for `HttpClient`.

The following code sends a reference token to an introspection endpoint:

```
var client = new HttpClient();

var response = await client.IntrospectTokenAsync(new TokenIntrospectionRequest
{
    Address = "https://demo.identityserver.io/connect/introspect",
    ClientId = "api1",
    ClientSecret = "secret",

    Token = accessToken
});
```

The response is of type `TokenIntrospectionResponse` and has properties
for the standard response parameters. You also have access to the the
raw response as well as to a parsed JSON document (via the `Raw` and
`Json` properties).

Before using the response, you should always check the `IsError`
property to make sure the request was successful:

```
if (response.IsError) throw new Exception(response.Error);

var isActive = response.IsActive;
var claims = response.Claims;
```
