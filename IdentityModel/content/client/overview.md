Overview
========

IdentityModel contains client libraries for many interactions with
endpoints defined in OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0. All of these
libraries have a common design, let\'s examine the various layers using
the client for the token endpoint.

Request and response objects
----------------------------

All protocol request are modelled as request objects and have a common
base class called `ProtocolRequest` which has properties to set the
endpoint address, client ID, client secret, client assertion, and the
details of how client secrets are transmitted (e.g. authorization header
vs POST body). `ProtocolRequest` derives from `HttpRequestMessage` and
thus also allows setting custom headers etc.

The following code snippet creates a request for a client credentials
grant type:

```
var request = new ClientCredentialsTokenRequest
{
    Address = "https://demo.identityserver.io/connect/token",
    ClientId = "client",
    ClientSecret = "secret"
};
```

While in theory you could now call `Prepare` (which internally sets the
headers, body and address) and send the request via a plain
`HttpClient`, typically there are more parameters with special semantics
and encoding required. That\'s why we provide extension methods to do
the low level work.

Equally, a protocol response has a corresponding `ProtocolResponse`
implementation that parses the status codes and response content. The
following code snippet would parse the raw HTTP response from a token
endpoint and turn it into a `TokenResponse` object:

```
var tokenResponse = await ProtocolResponse.FromHttpResponseAsync<TokenResponse>(httpResponse);
```

Again these steps are automated using the extension methods. So let\'s
have a look at an example next.

Extension methods
-----------------

For each protocol interaction, an extension method for
`HttpMessageInvoker` (that\'s the base class of `HttpClient`) exists.
The extension methods expect a request object and return a response
object.

It is your responsibility to setup and manage the lifetime of the
`HttpClient`, e.g. manually:

```
var client = new HttpClient();

var response = await client.RequestClientCredentialsTokenAsync(new ClientCredentialsTokenRequest
{
    Address = "https://demo.identityserver.io/connect/token",
    ClientId = "client",
    ClientSecret = "secret"
});
```

You might want to use other techniques to obtain an `HttpClient`, e.g.
via the HTTP client factory:

```
var client = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient("my_named_token_client");

var response = await client.RequestClientCredentialsTokenAsync(new ClientCredentialsTokenRequest
{
    Address = "https://demo.identityserver.io/connect/token",
    ClientId = "client",
    ClientSecret = "secret"
});
```

All other endpoint client follow the same design.

Some client libraries also include a stateful client object (e.g.
`TokenClient` and `IntrospectionClient`). See the corresponding section
