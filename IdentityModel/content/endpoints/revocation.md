The client library for [OAuth 2.0 token
revocation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009) is provided as an
extension method for *HttpClient*.

The following code revokes an access token token at a revocation
endpoint:

```
var client = new HttpClient();

var result = await client.RevokeTokenAsync(new TokenRevocationRequest
{
    Address = "https://demo.identityserver.io/connect/revocation",
    ClientId = "client",
    ClientSecret = "secret",

    Token = accessToken
});
```

The response is of type *TokenRevocationResponse* gives you access to
the the raw response as well as to a parsed JSON document (via the *Raw*
and *Json* properties).

Before using the response, you should always check the *IsError*
property to make sure the request was successful:

```
if (response.IsError) throw new Exception(response.Error);
```
